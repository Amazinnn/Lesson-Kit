## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Three-column shell with navigation

The workbench SHALL render a three-column desktop layout: a left navigation column with workspace and study navigation, a primary middle page, and a collapsible right Agent conversation column, with workspace-name and chapter context in the top bar (the machine course identifier SHALL NOT be shown there). At narrow widths the middle page SHALL remain the single primary column; the left and right columns SHALL become dismissible drawers opened by two compact icon controls in the top bar. Switching workspaces or pages SHALL preserve recorded pool state.

#### Scenario: Navigate from the left column

- **WHEN** the learner clicks a navigation entry in the left column
- **THEN** the middle area shows the corresponding page for the current workspace

#### Scenario: Open mobile navigation

- **WHEN** a learner at a narrow viewport activates the navigation icon
- **THEN** the left column opens as a drawer without hiding the middle page permanently

#### Scenario: Open mobile Agent conversation

- **WHEN** a learner at a narrow viewport activates the conversation icon
- **THEN** the right column opens as a drawer and can be dismissed back to the middle page

#### Scenario: Switch workspace without losing state

- **WHEN** the learner switches the workspace dropdown
- **THEN** the new workspace loads and previously recorded attempts, feedback, and signals remain intact in their original pool

#### Scenario: The top bar shows the name, not the identifier

- **WHEN** a workspace's course is an automatically allocated code and its name is the folder name
- **THEN** the top bar shows the workspace name, and the code does not appear there
